# Socket-Project
CSE 434 Socket Project 

So this is the first version of the client and server python files for the socket project. These files don't include any of the requirements but simply implement the ability to communicate together. The server can send a message to the client and vice-versa. The client also implements a basic message-creating function to create messages based on user-input.
